We have a grid of 128 nodes and are trying to find out how to use it to calculate 100,000 trades in the shortest time.
The trades are to be grouped into batches.
Each batch will run on one node. 
So if a batch contains 150 trades, they will all run serially on the chosen node for that batch.
We need to find how to allocate which batch to run on each of the 128 nodes such that the overall calculation time is minimised. 

Each trade takes a different time to calculate and its calculation time is shown in a table like the one below that is saved in a csv file:

Trade	Time
0	18
1	19
2	52
3	50
4	29
5	23
6	45
7	43
8	49
9	40


I would like you to advise me on the best way to use this table to determine how to group the trades into 128 batches such that the overall calculation time is minimised.

Can you suggest some python code to help me determine the best way to group the trades into batches?
